Super Bitcoin is built on the guiding principles of the blockchain trilemma—decentralization, security, and scalability— by constructing a five-layer protocol architecture. This protocol is based on the Bitcoin protocol and utilizes the Lightning Network for efficient peer-to-peer communication. To extend the functionality of Lightning Network nodes, Super Bitcoin integrates Taproot Consensus and combines Bitcoin SPV, Schnorr signatures, MAST contracts, and a BFT PoOS consensus mechanism to achieve scalable state management and transaction processing. On this foundation, Super Bitcoin further integrates multiple virtual machines, including WASM, EVM, SVM, MoveVM, and CairoVM, creating a multi-chain system based on lightning-chains that offers a diverse range of smart contract execution environments. This modular framework significantly enhances the system's scalability and flexibility while maintaining the decentralized nature of the Bitcoin network. Importantly, all lightning-chains share the Bitcoin network's consensus security, ensuring that the system remains highly secure as it scales.
