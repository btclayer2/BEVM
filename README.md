Super Bitcoin is a value-based internet centered around BTC, and secured by Bitcoin's consensus security. This value internet not only inherits the security of the existing Bitcoin network but also transcends BTC's current limitations of being solely used for transactions, providing the Bitcoin network with unlimited scalability and flexibility. Although the Lightning Network inherits Bitcoin's network security and offers partial scalability solutions, it still falls short in supporting smart contracts and further enhancing scalability. We propose a five-layer architecture for Super Bitcoin using the Bitcoin network as the kernel layer, maintaining system security and transaction irreversibility through the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism; building an efficient communication layer based on the Lightning Network, facilitating rapid transmission of asset information while preserving Bitcoin's decentralized nature; we introduce the Taproot Consensus as the extension layer, abstracting Lightning Network communication and asset information to provide a standardized interface for the upper virtual machine layer; a multi-chain layer, also known as the fusion layer, consists of multiple lightning chains secured by BTC consensus, integrating any mainstream virtual machine (VM) to achieve a "network of interconnected and interoperable chains" unified by BTC consensus; finally, at the application layer, providing developers with rich tools and interfaces to build a diverse application (DApp) ecosystem, all sharing the security of BTC consensus.
