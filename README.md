# BEVM (Buidling Super Bitcoin)
## [A Value Internet Sharing Bitcoin’s Consensus Security](https://github.com/btclayer2/SuperBitcoin)

Super Bitcoin is a value-based internet centered around BTC, and sharing Bitcoin's consensus security. This value internet not only inherits the security of the existing Bitcoin network but also transcends BTC's current limitations of being solely used for transfer, providing the Bitcoin network with unlimited scalability and flexibility.

Although the Lightning Network [2] inherits Bitcoin's network security and offers partial scalability solutions, it still falls short in supporting smart contracts and further enhancing scalability. We propose a five-layer architecture for Super Bitcoin using the Bitcoin network as the kernel layer, maintaining system security and transaction irreversibility through the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism; building an efficient communication layer based on the Lightning Network, facilitating rapid transmission of asset information while preserving Bitcoin's decentralized nature; we introduce the Taproot Consensus as the extension layer, abstracting Lightning Network communication and asset information to provide a standardized interface for the upper virtual machine layer; a multi-chain layer, also known as the fusion layer, consists of multiple lightning chains secured by BTC consensus, integrating any mainstream virtual machine (VM) to achieve a "Multi-chain interconnection“ and ”multi-chain interoperability” unified by BTC consensus; finally, at the application layer, providing developers with rich tools and interfaces to build a decentralized application (DApp) ecosystem, all sharing the security of BTC consensus.

## BEVM Development Phases
The development of BEVM has undergone a deep reflection on the core design concepts of Bitcoin and Ethereum, and has gradually formed the current paradigm through multiple technical explorations.
### 1. BTC Layer2 Exploration
- **Goal**: Address Bitcoin’s limited scalability by using Layer2 solutions to improve transaction throughput.  
- **Lessons Learned**: While technically feasible, Layer2 solutions lacked strong ecological demand, meaning they did not fundamentally change Bitcoin’s usage or achieve broad adoption.

### 2. Taproot Consensus
- **Innovation**: Combined Bitcoin SPV state channels with Taproot technology to enable decentralized custody and expand Bitcoin’s smart contract capabilities.  
- **Reflections**: Bitcoin (BTC) is already widely adopted as a currency in centralized exchanges and mining pools, with relatively limited demand for decentralization-based expansion. What truly requires enhancement is Bitcoin’s consensus mechanism rather than BTC’s monetary function alone.

### 3. SuperBitcoin
- **Direction**: Proposed a new crypto system that shares the security advantages of Bitcoin’s consensus.  
- **Limitations**: Improved consensus security but did not solve the “dreamworld disconnection” in Ethereum-like VMs. Such systems run only within their internal liquidity environment and lack the ability to perceive and interact with real-world data and states.

  - [SuperBitcoin White Paper(Chinese)](https://github.com/BitAgere/BitAgere_WhitePaper/blob/main/docs/Super_Bitcoin_Whitepaper_CN.pdf)

### 4. BitAgere
- **Problem**: Identified parallels between Bitcoin’s mechanical consensus and AI Agents’ abstract cognition, leading to the concept of BitAgere.  
- **Innovation**: Based on SuperBitcoin, focused on solving mechanical consensus’ perception gap. AI Agents’ input-sensing capability is abstracted and connected on-chain, enabling crypto systems to have real-world perceptive power. This deep integration of Crypto and AI Agents forms the basis for BitAgere.

### 5. BEVM(λ) Paradigm
- **Discovery**: Through introspecting Bitcoin’s design philosophy, we formulated the BEVM(λ) paradigm. It provides systemic theoretical guidance by examining Bitcoin’s success from four core aspects: the Individual model, lambda calculus, consensus algorithm, and consensus-aware algorithm.  
- **Direction**: BEVM(λ) inherits Bitcoin’s principles of energy conservation and decentralized emergence while enhancing autonomy and intelligence. Powered by the Agere subsystem and supported by distributed stateless computation and consensus-aware algorithms, BEVM(λ) paves the way for diverse future applications and the comprehensive development of intelligent crypto systems.
